ABSTRACT: We investigated effects of prevalence and case distribution on radiologist diagnostic
performance as measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and
sensitivity-specificity in lab-based reader studies evaluating imaging devices.
Our retrospective reader studies compared full-field digital mammography (FFDM) to screen-film
mammography (SFM) for women with dense breasts. Mammograms were acquired from the prospective
Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST). We performed five reader studies that differed
in terms of cancer prevalence and the distribution of non-cancers. Twenty radiologists participated
in each reader study. Using split-plot study designs, we collected recall decisions and multi-level
scores from the radiologists for calculating sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. Differences in
reader-averaged AUCs slightly favored SFM over FFDM (biggest AUC difference: 0.047, SE=0.023 p=0.047),
where standard error (SE) accounts for reader and case variability. The differences were not
significant at a level of 0.01 (0.05/5 reader studies). The differences in sensitivities and
specificities were also indeterminate. Prevalence had little effect on AUC (largest difference: 0.02),
whereas sensitivity increased and specificity decreased as prevalence increased. We found that AUC
is robust to changes in prevalence, while radiologists were more aggressive with recall decisions
as prevalence increased.
